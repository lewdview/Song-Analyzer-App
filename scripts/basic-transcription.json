Unless you're but a starry man, I think you will Do you ever want to know what it's like to feel the opposite? All the love that you give on your day How to feel knocked down, hurt down, stepped on, unwanted If you ever want those feelings Better stay clear of any of your negative feelings Wanna point the finger when you can't see beyond your own view How it feels to be unloved Do you ever want to feel that? Are you just happy with all the things that one life can't stand? Oh, how it feels to be unloved You got no one there next to you, all your heart does ain't for you To get up and sing, to do something for yourself but anxiety rocks your mainframe If you can't go on, one more step To be unloved Do you ever want to know that? Does it sound like the worst thing that could ever happen to you? To be unloved To be here all alone As you reach your peaks in your fast life zone, I want you to understand Your life's pretty good so stop searching Your life's got things that others don't And if you can't see the bucket from the trees Baby, you should know that you can't be free Do you know what it's like to be me? Do you even want to hear, listen, or understand? What it's like to be unloved Feel unjust Have the whole world staring at you Cause they can see you're on the rush to be unloved Be just a Cryptomaniac in anxiety Do you want to feel unloved? I didn't think so So let me take a breath and have some gratitude for what you see in front of you You don't have to be the number one thing you're trying to fulfill at all To understand you've got the good stick and the amount of people that care for you Oh, it's so true",

I'm writing this curse, I curse myself from the cursing I did to tell you I'm right. Cause I know it, but I don't show it, yeah. There's no reason for me to say I'm right, because perspective wins in the end of the night. It's your fight, it's your flight, it's all you're moving. I just wanna be an extra, come on chat, I swear it grew because cursing us is gonna curse. Every step we take beyond that with the negative we hit and fight back with. Yeah, cursing us till the end of our legit. I don't wanna lose you now. I don't wanna lose any progress we found as this human race. We've gotta stand this test, hey. We're cursed if we curse. We're cursed if we just judge and put us down before we even stood up for the test now. No one's giving you your final grade, yeah. No one's giving you the okay to fail yourself and flunk out of life, so stop cursing yourself. In the end you'll find that you're your own worst enemy. And all you did to hold yourself up was all just a temporary release from the curse that your parents gave to you. But they didn't know and you better even do. You've been manipulated from the groove, right on the whack so you can't put your heart out. Telling people they're wrong for their own view of them. It can't be that way, you're not them, you're only you. Fucking with the curse of you. You don't know your own strength to fight on through it, yeah. Giving to gifts but gifts by God to us from our own heart, yeah. Stop the curse. Stop the hurts, yeah. When it's over, it's over. When there's no more, there's no more. So stop cursing at yourself and telling yourself that your life isn't your life. It is and it's pretty. It's pretty like pretty pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink flowers. Like, you spread it open a little bit and it's like pink. It's like where we came from, you know what I'm saying? It's pretty and pink. I think that's what I meant to say.",

It can be just me and you, dancing in the moonlight. I know it's hard. Too much and too much and too far. And just have for me. And I know that you can't go that far again. I don't say we can't be more than friends. I'm just saying maybe it's a trend. Think about the world when it goes. Think about it all and just relax a second. Relax a second and escape. Let your mind go. Let your mind free. Let it all come and be a part of something new, a part of something free. Baby, it's ecstasy, hey. When you come with me, no. Baby, it's you and me. I don't care what they say. I don't care if they tell me to go. No, it's you and me. You and me tonight. We can be free skiing. Just can't lie. It's just the moment of the day. I know that the night is hot. And I know that it lets you start. And I don't want to repeat anything that you've done before. I want to show you some more. I want to love you. Like you've never been found out before. I'm rocked down again. I'm talking about questions of eternity. Conversation knocks your left out loud. Knocks your breath out loud. Makes you say out loud. Makes you exclaim. Tonight is our night.  Baby, when you come with me, you know we can be free. We can float on ecstasy in the moon glow. Dancing in the moonlight. Dancing in the moon, you know. We can be there. I don't even know what we do. But for starters, maybe we talk all night and find something blue. To be put in with. To be more than that. To have a little escape and be more than that. Who knows what tomorrow brings? But I know that you are the fire that ignites the night. The fire that ignites the night. I'm rooting for you. I'm wishing for you, man. www.mooji.org www.mooji.org",

I'm like, poop, poop, poop, hop out on you. Don't care if you like that, I love it. I'm just here with the gunman above it. Taking over the body with my poses. Taking out everybody like a god with the ocean and emotion. Feeling that one spectacular emotion of hate. Let the gun go, debate. What you say? What does God, God without me, who am I?

Bruised up and beat down, then turn to bleeding. I see death is in the air, I can feel it in my breathing. Plus my odds are getting lower, gotta guess the reason. How am I awake? It feel like I am dreaming. A rose by any name is just a flower out of season. Depends how it rise from die or the cement. Apparently my future's only relevant in past tense. That's the case and clearly not in the present. It's common sense, maybe you should take a second and figure out what I've hidden in my message. Instead of being blinded by your own objections, protection is intended for subjection. Only God can judge me, nigga, what's with all the questions? Absolution itself is motive for depression. What is God, what is God without me, who am I? If I am not he, I'm demonized. My confidence got me paralyzed. I refuse to believe in a dead man till I die. Till I die, I'll be singing your praise.

Got the earth healing, is it Iran or Samus? Iran, I don't know, Mikey, I can't understand. You don't ever get to uplift the multiple people with multiple bonus codes. You're not a joke, you're the kindest one there, so I ask you one time, is it fair? Stake me, stake you, stake me, stake you. I like them both from the .com to the US. I think it's lives worth fucking here. I think it's lives worth bucking here. If you want to be there, you're gonna be there. If you don't want to give a little bit to your community, then don't be there. Cause you take a little bit, you put it down. It rewards you. Come on, let's be a part of it. League of Legends runescape, I don't know. I told you, I'd be here. Not playing one of those, if you want to play like Destiny 2, man, I got you. Coming back at you. Coming back at you, Mikey, girls are reasons. I watch Saturday, I watch all the way. I watch you sitting there like, come on, be your way. Tell them you need a reason, you're at the Realm Deposit Land. Come on, you can make those bonuses. 51 black? Can we get one more fucking 51 black, god damn it. Oh my god, it's not.",

Then I understand it's hard that you breathe Yeah, it's right that you waste If you sit there not being true Turn your own faith in place I'll see you then There's more to life than any other Thing that you could ever dream of Where I'm being true Where I'm wanting to Dream with me a little louder There's more to life There's more to life than the dark to finding grey A matter of where you just start To look left And you're here Yeah That's how the end of the summer feels With you You're looking great in that tan Your bathing suit's on fire, baby I can't stop but to misbehave",

Did you faint of heart? Nothing told me to stay there, I did. I can see that you just don't wanna be anything but just lost in the light. Thinking you're the greatest thing from the end of time. Thinking it all revolves around the one spark that's you. Damn it, that can't be true. It takes more people around. Can't do it by yourself, I'm sorry. No matter what, all you do is frown at me and frown at our energy. When we found light and love, now you just say it's negativity. Oh, faint of heart of me. Yeah, I can see you now, you're just not dreaming anymore. Lost in the cosmos of life and you can see that you just could be happy. If you weren't so faint of heart and scared, you could be happy. But you're too scared. When I look at your heart, is it faintly there? Heartbeat is faintly feeling anything here. Fear takes you. Oh, I know you. Want me, want you, want me. What is your fear? Controlling your heartbeat of your life. Still just down, still just down, still just a memory of frown. Still down, still down, still down, living out fear. Make us what we see around. All of us is this. What we're making inside of us, a feeling here. Don't be afraid to heal. Don't be afraid to tell yourself you're the number one deal. You deserve all this freedom. Don't be afraid to heal. If it's your life and your heart is faintly there. Run around me, I'm here. Don't fear again. Sometimes it all goes so, so I guess it's the end. Faintly I hear a voice screaming back. From the abyss of the things you thought wasn't so evident. Sometimes I think you're coming back for me. But then reality sets in. It's faintly gone and it's reality. You're gone, reality. You're me, reality. You're just nothing that I could ever be proud of again. You took it all. Faintly I don't hear shit from you at all.

It feels good to feel good. So feel good with me, yeah. Hakuna Matata. No worries, yesterday be our guest. This is what we come to you. I just, and just, and just, and just, and just. Oh yeah. I know you wanna be happy even if you're sad. Oh baby, baby. I know you want life. I know you wanna be alright. And I know it's not bad to dream a little bit, dream with me. I know it gets savage sometimes, you know. You see that girl you want and she's like nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, not today. Gets a little rough, but you dress yourself up, come back tough. That's right, because there's a different person waiting for you. It's all about the soul, and it's all about the challenge. Not having you feel good inside of your own bed. When you keep mixing all up, and you bake your own brain into what you wanna be. I'm telling you. Hakuna Matata. Remember that with me. It means no worries for the rest of your day, because you love you. You see. Baby, now we're dancing. On the ceiling, family everywhere. Now we're doing it on top of you know where. Come on down. Light them up. Come on down. Vibrate them up. Come on down. You're the wonder man, baby. We're making history. There's another one of me. There's another one of you. Another one of you. There's another one of me. That's what makes the whole thing. Together come together. Be family. Be family with me. Here we go left, here we go right. We'll just figure it out. All through the day. All through the night. I am not dancing alone. I love the stereo sound. I can grow in love with all the thoughts around me. It feels so good to be alive. Come and dance with me down the history of our own divides. Self split. Self split.",

Why do you want us to be insane? I'm begging you not to divide. I'm begging you to cry if you're crying and to feel before you become just the death, murder, cold over ice. I can't even understand your whys. I can't even understand your whys. And just hold that as truth for the end of everyone you know, cause it all goes away. In the end it all goes away. Stop with your judgement of me, because I go away too. I bet you don't know what it's like without me in your mind. I bet you don't know what it's like without the kindness that shows you everything that I've done. Every time I told you you were amazing and now you just sit there numb from any compliment I give you. Are you really that cool? Is your ego vortex running up because it falls down just like the cups of everyone that had their drink? Had a little too much wine and now they're off to the left and they've gone too much. They're yelling, it's a fight, it's just gone, I'm through it. I'm gonna go super. I'm gonna go super. I'm gonna go super saiyan and just destroy it all then. This is the only fault because it all goes away. In the end my dark disciple, my Sith, my man, my pair, my teammate, we all die too. I'm sorry you're choosing this view, because you're no better than anyone you know. But I'm gonna tell you this one time, if you're in the zone, you ask for help and if you're given help, then you better reciprocate that circular thought, that motion, because if you don't, your time's coming soon, cause it all goes away. Through the light, burst through the time, spiral through the everything, that makes the universe whole. The red dwarfs to the supernovas, the black hole of despair and the void that got us here. It all goes away. You think your time's a little fast, you think you got more, gotta make it last then. 1.5 seconds, it's over. Did you tell your loved ones, you loved them, because it all goes away. Whether you hold on, you throw it, or you just walk, it all goes away. So treasure that life, and treasure your ride, to find the things that make you happy. Stop shitting on everyone else's, because one day you'll see that you can't fucking do that, ok? If you're gonna continue to do that, we're gonna kick your fucking ass, ok? I'm not saying we're taking out this world, that's your mother job.",

You bring your friend back into a thug Cause that's all you ever know You get it and you're fighting with you Only this time you realize you better decide again Cause you're on the floor bleeding from his ass He hit you again You're lying in your puddle of your own blood Thinking why this again? Shut the f**k up What did I do to deserve this? But it's too late You would've known this is your last breath He said he's gonna take his gun and put it to your head He just shut the f**k up You beg for your life and he says it's too late Are you even sitting there crying on the couch? Like come the f**k on Get the f**k out of here Don't be a f**king b**ch You're the last guys in the world Don't be quick to judge",

        "text": "The rabbit hole is a funny experience, right? The rabbit hole is something of a tumultuous step that you gotta take, right? The idea that you could hide in there and it could be a sanctuary, or you could hop in there and you could get eaten by the monster that's taking over your home. It's a dark, dark, dark place that you either find sanctuary in or you find death in, right? And then, I don't know, it's almost like when you come out of the vault and fall out, you know? Light's pretty bright, the world looks different, and maybe you understand things or view it in a different perspective. I'm always, in my whole entire life up to this moment, I'm always looking for rabbit holes. Those situations, those moments that challenge me, that make me view something in a completely different way than I viewed it before. And I hope I survive all of those moments. Metaphorically, you can put that anywhere in your life, but I think that's what Lewis Carroll was talking about, when Alice basically goes down the rabbit hole and meets a rabbit. What kind of trip is that? Who are you, Alice in Wonderland? Or are you just Alice in your own land and now nobody even understands that you've been through Wonderland, you know? And maybe you go back to those experiences. Maybe you go back to being like, I hope I'm in Wonderland again, you know? Because it taught me so much about who I am that I'm going to go back into that rabbit hole. I'm going to look for another one because I don't think I'm fully formed. When are you fully formed? When is anybody? I think the closest you can get to being fully formed, in my opinion, is the moment before you're going to die. Or the moment before you're born. Okay, yeah, but we don't remember that one, so I have no recollection. Exactly, that's how close we are to that. No doubt. I mean, our time in life is short, right? But you don't remember it, but you remember the rabbit hole. So what I'm saying is, I think a point where you get that you're not going to search for another rabbit hole and you indifference is the moment that you die. Maybe it's not physically, right? Maybe it's not like I'm dying physically. That's another moment. If you search for rabbit holes all the time, then you're going to... But you can definitely die. And still be alive. Mentally and emotionally. When you stop searching for the things that are going to make you reevaluate your existence and be... Well, then there's also the difference of going down the rabbit hole and learning a whole bunch for your individual self and then jumping in the rabbit hole again with, say, I don't know, a partner? Okay, but that... That's a whole different rabbit hole. Well, no, I mean, it's not even a rabbit hole because it's still a rabbit hole. Because a rabbit hole only fits one rabbit. That's the point of it. It's a hole that's built by one rabbit. Oh my gosh! That goes into the hole and it finds it and it comes out and it's a different person and it can now relate to other rabbits that have been down holes like that. Either that or you go down the hole and you get eaten by a snake. Because if a snake is taking itself up in your hole, then you're going to go find it to reevaluate yourself. And that, to me, would be like somebody that's like, I'm just going to go walk down to this corner to go, I don't know, check out this new restaurant and then get shot in the fucking dome. Do you know what I'm saying? That's a rabbit hole. They're like, I want to try a new experience. That's what I want to do. I want to try a new restaurant. Just not as intense. No, but... I mean, the dying part would be totally... You don't know if that's going to happen to any rabbit hole. Even if you take your car up the street. So taking your car for a drive is a rabbit hole? No, but the idea to want to learn something new for taking your car down the drive or maybe experience life in a different way. Maybe look at the trees and the leaves in a different way. Maybe be like, what fucking kind of tree is that? That could be a rabbit hole where you become better. You become more aware of your surroundings and have a different perception on life with that gained knowledge. Where are you trying to go? I'm going that way. Cool. I'm trying to go that way too, man. I like that way, dude. It's got green lights and stuff. But that's what I'm saying. So maybe if you take a step back when you're driving down the road and you go, we see all these signs that are there as information for you. But then you just stop for a second, man, and maybe look at the pink flowers below the sign, right? And think about the gardening moment with that token. Maybe take up gardening with me. Maybe be like, whoa, how do I do this? How do I do this? How do I even make the fucking metal signs that the information is presented on me? Because then that gives you a new perception, a new take on what these things are. So instead of it being a stop sign, it's Bob's stop sign. There's humanity behind the metal in the world. I mean, that's just one example of the rabbit holes that we could go down every day. And when you stop going down rabbit holes because of fear of the snake. A snake may be down there. You know what I'm saying? It may have curled up there underneath in the sun's hot heat. And it may be there. That motherfucking snake may be there. So I'm not going to go down a rabbit hole. I don't want to find safety in knowing my thoughts are expanding and my information and me as a person is still growing. Okay, I hear you. I hear you. But growing and everything you just said right now is good. The only way that you learn some places, like say you're in school, is because you have somewhere safe to go back to, okay? So that's the same thing. So you go out in the world and you experience it, right? Uh-huh. And then when you go back to your safe maybe rabbit hole. So maybe going out is just taking it in, maybe the stop signs, but then looking back on it in your safe place is being in that rabbit hole. Thinking outside the box. Thinking about the people that made the signs. Thinking about the people that made these buildings. Thinking about how much of their soul and effort they put into these buildings and into that moment. That's really deep. That's a part of them and their energy that they put to society. You know what I'm saying? And just thinking about that and learning how they did that gets you further. I see. I hear what you're saying. I'm not disagreeing with you. There's also levels to the rabbit hole that also help you know what you are willing and not willing to go. Okay, so you're saying... Knowing your own boundaries. Alright, well, so... It's kind of a contradiction of going down the rabbit hole, but you wouldn't know and it wouldn't be a contradiction. A boundary, and so you've done it. That's what I'm saying. You've become better. You know more of who you are. You're just explaining another aspect of said rabbit hole. Right. Deal breakers for yourself independently. Well, I mean that's how you envelop your person. Deal breakers, just experiencing the world and learning about the world is what I was going with with the rabbit hole thing. Right. Deal breakers, I don't know what you're talking about. So I guess you could be like, dude, if these guys made this sign wrong, dude, that's a deal breaker for me. I can't live around here. Like if a sign told you to go this way and it was opposite of the way you should go, like a sign on the side of the road, you'd be like, I don't trust this place I'm in. You know? If they're like, if one stoplight is off and it says green on both sides and then you go and you're going with green and it's green on the other side and you get a car accident, you're like, fuck that stoplight. Fuck that. I've been taught that this stoplight should be this way so when I go through and it emotionally hurts me or something like that happens, that's how you re-evaluate it and be like, okay, that's a deal breaker. I don't like that stoplight. That stoplight malfunctions all the fucking time. Like a false alarm? I don't know. What are you talking about? Keep left, keep right, there's two lanes. See, that's where signs malfunction because you're like, oh no, I can't turn right here. And man, man, the things that you say without just fucking saying it is a rabbit hole to me. What did I, what happened? Because you're talking about deal breakers. Where did deal breakers come out in life? I didn't push myself through what you were saying. That's what I'm saying. To battle you on where I was coming from. I was coming from individually having deal breakers for yourself. Like having set goals or like, I'm not going to drink five beers today, I'm only going to drink one. It's a deal breaker. Making deals with myself to better myself. I'm saying like deal breakers. Okay, well this isn't, this isn't inner dialogue. Well, going down, okay, but how is it, how do you know it's not inner dialogue if it's a rabbit hole? That is filled with inner dialogue and outer dialogue. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not arguing with you. Or going against what you're saying. And I just turned him off. You think I'm coming from a negative ass place and I'm not. Love, I wasn't coming from a negative place. Got you, I've just lost my train of thought. Oh, I'm sorry. And that's fine. Because I forgot you were supposed to be your champion. Why don't you just tell me to shut up? What are you talking about? It's fine, I got it.",

That's how we roll in here That's what you're showing here Taking your shovel, having it over with me Are you digging my grave, bitch? Are you digging my grave, bitch? I told you open up and you saw the wall in me Who even forced that shit out of me Told me I was too much I was the one with too many feelings Even then you were like Please tell me how you think I can help you How you helping now? How you helping now with that shovel thing in my own grave? What the fuck, bitch? Please don't do it like that I said please don't do it like that Always in the dark Away from the start This is a waving light Dark A light that's running out I see your silhouette I see everything you left out If you were real you would be here But you want to run away If you could heal you'd be here But you're running away every day And every step that it Gets a little bit uncomfortable Time is never right for you Time is never right for you What are we gonna Wait, it's just me here Singing to myself in the mirror I know I can see you here I know I can see you at the corner of me Are we coming in clearly? Hate me now Break me now Take it all from me Lights up above me, we wish that Lights up above me, we should be I felt amazing, I felt incredible But I guess we ran it too much Ran the race out the bed Lost touch, now we're sitting here Was our love unfair? Was regret mounding up you? Took a left, right when I quit the deal I'm like, where the fuck you going, boo? Took a right, went left With a new light where you're going, boo It's hard to feel the abandonment Yeah, it's hard to feel that All we meant was just some cheap-ass thrill When you were sitting here Was a day good enough for you to be that? Treat me like an object, is that all I was? A big fucking cop for you to scream out to? Goodbye, bitch, goodbye, bitch, oh Don't cry, bitch, don't cry, bitch, I'm gone Away, away I'm gone away from you There's nothing left to say Just go away",

Get to justice. Mind not. Years of wars. Tools and goals. Law. A door to own. Other parts of stones. In a zone. Computer tell me to don't. Submit the pledge. Shut up. Eclipse. Lights. Spliff. Brains drown. You just repeat the sounds. You question the crown. Sony. Ballot. Blot. Denial. Give anything to disagree with me. Everything for what I do. World new. Yeah. The world new. Pull up in the bench. Intolerated and spent. Disconnected. Disappointed. Left against end. Pretty bleed. Evil states. I cannot hear. It's one to fear though.  You get high. Don't get high with me. You get high. Don't get high with me. Forget life. Forget day. Forget all things. Tell me why. Don't get high with me. You get high. Don't get high with me. Don't get high with me.  You get high with me. When life's gone. It's all ugly. When the high might erupt. Create poverty. So come along and give in. Doesn't matter, no one wins. Strata and self rights is close. With a face hidden. Like the cobra in the monster form within. And then I'll read what I rhyme. And I'll roll what I know. That's why we've got to tose our own diapers. The void you avoid by the end of a point,  You're so slick, you're lust. Tough as cliff. Hydroponic acid hits. Set sail, your mind's adrift. Even though you're going round trip. No escaping it. Evading it. Probably should engage a bit. Don't be a slave to shit. Your design of D-shit is legit. The bowl is lit. Come and let your mind slip a bit. Better than always. Tripping over shit. Chilling. Yeah, you fucking villain. Conscious mind spilling from the narrow synapse. Would you like a spinal tap? Welcome, welcome. One and all. Forget memories big and small. In these blurry halls. Muddy walls. Higher than an electric arm. Milky is the way I like to stay. Every minute. Every day. Your outlet needs a plug. Supplement those emotions, bro. Toss them out the window. No good to you now. Slip under meta-cover. Tell your legs are made of rubber. Oh yeah, when you get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. You get high. You get high. You get high. You get high. You get high. You're dead high. You get high. You're dead high. You get high. You get high.   Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Come get high with me. Get high with me.     Get high.

Is it fucking you like it's fucking my own wife, ay? Is the level coming with the trial gonna be better? Are we gonna feel that? Are we gonna be a waste war? Are we gonna be a heart attack? Are we even coming for more? Because do we wanna be alive? Do we wanna feel it inside? Do we want the fever and the sorrow of death? Is this a chance to put it all night? When we ignite the light, you say, I can't. Can it be better than that? Can it be better? Can he see it better? Can he see it clearer? Can he even do anything like that in the mirror? When you look at yourself after your actions are clear, oh, so clear. Are you a home, my dear? Are you lying with your skeletons, closet dying all inside? It's just a graveyard dig that you keep digging. Dig it down deeper, dig it, dig it down deeper. Till you see nothing out, and the sunlight comes, and you don't know where your mind is. And I know then that you're all space and time, but you're still inside. Fuck that state that I'm lost. Fuck being the one that I bought and said, I am fine. If I'm taking this, if I'm taking this, if I'm taking this, no, it'll be fun. If I'm taking this, if I'm taking this, it'll be fun. Yeah. Bake it better, bake it, bake it. I see it. Bake it better, be it better. I'll be it for you if you need it. Just a little step, a little sound, and you'll know it's lovely. You'll know it's lovely. I see angels underneath the streets, the only thing that meets. Angels underneath the streets, they're there to greet me. Angels underneath the streets, they're there to be with me. They see me different, and I see them instead, yo. Soapy waves of the cyanide and smoke. Linch white sitting there, all you dealt with. Different white, the waves, and you feel it like sun rays dripping on the drip. You can't replace it. It sits inside of you. It sits inside of you. Sits inside of you. Out of gold and the wealth of everything that came before this. Before that, before all the hits and the blisters and the misters and the kissers and the kissers. And to fuck all the things from out of spell of mind inside, you know you just paint your own world. Ooh, high as a motherfucker. High as a motherfucker. Yeah, high as a motherfucker. High as a motherfucker. Solo, solo like a move. I'm floating away. I'm floating like a move. I'm floating away. High as a motherfucker. High as a motherfucker. Can you feel the price of a chunk? In the face when you look. Are you alone?  Dying for me. I'm dying. Did you know how to let go? Stop dying for yourself. Stop dying for me. Stop trying for me. Stop lying for me. Stop tonight for me. Stop getting over me and fucking me and doing everything that you're putting to destroy your own mind. How you gonna be a partner, dear? How you even trying to fucking climb? How you go up? You're just down, down, toxic to the head, the dog, and the fat. End of time, disaster. End of mind for Ryan. Just for Ryan. Just a lion. Is it Brian or is it a Hawaiian fantasy? Water dragon set. Water dragon hate. Like a freestyle moment and you know you can relate with the Z and Dr. W. And I come back. This shirt's all wet. Child with the fucking poker trap.  Child with the poker trap. And you want your money back. You can't fucking have it, fucking fool. You can't have it. You can't have it, fucking fool. You can't have it. You can't have it. You can't have it. You might say it's the end. Say it's the end to you. It's the end to you, motherfucker. Are you alive? I see time and space beyond that, motherfucker. I see time and space like you want to go have like a latte or lunch, like stop fucking living. It can't end everything you see. Through communication, it's more. You get more. You see it. Fruitions of life everywhere. It's what we do.",

Been looking for that someone, something, someplace. Anything to erase the void that I hold every day. Always told stop looking it'll come. If I do that I'll die old and alone. Never took the time. Merely just observed. Everyone around me found that special place. Feeling of want, love, happiness. The feeling of home. Somewhere to go. A place to call their own. Man you know the feelings we don't wanna hold. If I could be so bold. When will I find the time to find when the heart and soul that they collide? When will it be my time? When will I find the time to find when the heart and soul that they collide? When will it be my time? When will it be our time? I never expected to find it. Expectations lead to heartache. Thought that if I was patient and waiting my time would come. But the days grow old into the night. How long is too long to wait for something that can never come? I don't wanna do this all alone. Gas and match. Wrong time still here. Make it last. Go past the hurt. Loss of pride. Make a commitment. Get sentiment. Be open to life. The new, new, new. See what you need. Eat past mistakes. Life quakes and morn wakes. Time is finite. Open to the infinite. Beyond this world you'll see. Way past me. Fear forces the close spark. Your heart and soul collide. From the ashes you find you. Well who knew? Fear forces the close spark. Your heart and soul collide. From the ashes you find you. Who knew? Yeah, who knew you'd find you? Through all the pain and everything you've gone through, baby. Who knew you'd find you? When will I find the time to find? When the heart and soul that they collide. When will it be my time? When will I find the time to find? When the heart and soul that they collide. When will it be my time? When will it be my time? When will it be our time? When will it be our time? When will it be our time? When will it be our time? When will it be our time? When will it be our time? ",

Some people will tell you when you're small, you'll see that Don't think too much about that, roll your life in round 9 Don't roll in your dread, don't roll in your crime Don't be like benign, be free at all times Be cautious to the ones that take you away from you When the moon is shining, light me up in that dark I need you to bask in the afterglow When the thing is just, it's pulling you apart There's nowhere to turn, you're just basking in the afterglow When all the lines go from me to you, and you to them I say go on past it Every time you think of me inside you When the show is just, it gets dark and it's More than you can ever picture, bask in the afterglow And your heart is just, something's settled there It's not what you wanted, but it's what you needed Know that's afterglow inside it, the afterglow beyond it Silver lining guides your heart to start a fire of thunder If you're not dead, you're still here baby You're roaming in the afterglow Afterglow, that's right, me and you, together, dude, chick That's how we roll That's how we roll I got it, I'm telling you that Don't lose hope, kitty cat And you may have our space bar And another R",

Titties out and an ass so fat I ain't tripping and all about that It's what you do, it's what you do Oh, when you're looking so good It's like a memory of things we should How many times we skip this part But maybe we can get right to where it starts Got pleasure in me And pleasure in you Does it come from within Or is it just our foundational view?

Or are we here to die? We can't be living separate lives anymore Is that change not good for you? Is that a little bit of a different perspective to show you You're not on the path that you think you should be So are you gonna unite us? Or are you just putting us out to die? As we untie all our lives Will you unite or are you here to die? Like gratitude shows you a different why We all see differently, different than a view of us And if that other piece doesn't unite, it makes you cry at night You should chew it away, put space between you and that idea If it's not working for you, kill it in the end, don't you? Are you willing to unite? Or are you here to suffocate our lives? Make it so it never existed, the easier why of me There's no need to even talk about it, it's clearly that we see different about us So with that, there's nothing to pout or doubt",

The teachings growing in my blood Rays of doubt from my eyes While I'm insane Too much was bought in this past year Wish I wouldn't have paid the cost Set a roadblock, lead it to a vacant lot My mind's in this world, don't tear it up But this shit is what I got It's what I got, it's what I got, yeah It's what I got Can't stop thinking about it I never was about it But now my mind's clouded And doubted, it's crowded I need a way out, need to figure out What life's about, need to reroute my ways Get the hell out, I need to find my way back home Black and nomad on the land, it's free to roam Come and go, my mind snaps back, I'm in the zone Here to let you know that it's gonna be known Can you believe? The teachings growing in my blood Rays of doubt from my eyes While I'm insane Too much was bought in this past year I wish I wouldn't have paid the cost Set a roadblock, lead it to a vacant lot My mind's in this world, don't tear it up But this shit is what I got It's what I got, it's what I got, yeah It's what I got Let heart beat down your spine Vibration on the thoughts of your sexual crimes But if you want those thoughts on, on your mind Take you by the neck, gang Put your face down from behind Listen up and feel this energy A shockwave of thought, cheek it, are you hearing me? This path is damned, please flee A blind world without the thoughts of you and me This intuition provokes fears and dreams That I broke from this lifetime of doing drugs Till I choked, lost my girl, world, life, and the will to be loved Though I'm not here to despise or spit your lies Try to go clean and make, make your life fly Every time that you want me Just another second to just scream some Baby girl, just breathe, yeah, huh You just breathe, can you believe? The tension growing in my blood Face I'm down from a high cloud, I'm insane Too much was bought in this past year Wish I would've paid the cost Set a roadblock, lead it to a vacant lot My mind's just fucked up, tear it up But this shit is what I got It's what I got, it's what I got, yeah It's what I got It's what I got, it's what I got, yeah Time to take a step back from the brain Take the truth, don't see, float on my waves Of advice I write, act to entice, make your life nice Time to feel what we're saying, teach and push and run, test brain Words of wisdom to make it change Place a new life to rearrange Feel the sun, make it last Recall times so fast, fucked up past Now all gone, set a rewind, it's just What I got, it's a lot What you got, it's squat When I drop, I make it hot Project in a dot, got the game locked Got you in the scope at twelve o'clock Pull it back, watch it drop, like you faded on a crop Eyes squinted, minds demented, windows tinted Feel what I feel from beginning to the ending I'm winning every time, cost to finish on these raps It's mine, it's Jax, it's mine, it's fine Catch you on an incline Can you believe The tension growing in my blood Rays of doubt from a hot flower I'm insane Too much was bought in this past year Wish I would have paid the cost Set a roadblock, lead it to a vacant lot My mind is fucked up till I Fuck this shit It's what I got, it's what I got, it's what I got Motherfucker, it's what I got Can you believe The tension growing in my blood Rays of doubt from a hot flower I'm insane Too much was bought in this past year Wish I would have paid the cost Set a roadblock, lead it to a vacant lot My mind is fucked up till I Fuck this shit It's what I got, it's what I got, it's what I got Motherfucker, it's what I got Thanks for watching!",

You watch the raining tides arise I know that you feel the wind Know that you don't understand Only Swimming energies Inside your mind But know that I'm here Navigating the same waters I've run Enough times Yet I just hear with me I see some line above the trees Through the forest of the dark You get stuck with inside your mind It's not a heartless It's not crime It's just the things of you That see the things that relate to you Blue When the sky is orange I know you find me there Even though Nuclear meltdown's right around the corner Don't push too hard Just let go And stay in the groove of the beam Inside your heart That guides you to the things That makes you open free Keep it alive As you fall between the seams On what you think is right A hypocritical thought You fight yourself at night I've been there Many times over The course of what you think you can attain What you end and what you know is that It's all in the name Or what you call yourself in that mind frame And I just want you to know that",

As, as you walk by Hey, what do you see? As you walk by your life inside of your history in front of you Sorry it worked out this way that you had to run I'm sorry that you can't forgive me from the number Get down in the whole years of my life Now you're thinking there's nothing there But just hype cause I didn't hold it down in a way But you miss me when you get far away A whole congruency that's circled around The imperfect truth of We're in love It feels like heaven when you touch me We're in love It feels like heaven when you, when you touch me It's different degree of all the things that we see In front of life a certainty Man, my girl's calling out the other line My love with music is gonna get my line Shut down for real What do you feel? When you look at me like you're not trying to heal Yeah, what do you feel? When I say you're my heaven and you close the door And don't purgatory My lesson is clear that it's needed I hope that you don't come conceited On the surface cause life like many levels And I'm just all so nervous Cause I'm in front of my own world In the back it's just me I'm just sitting next to you cooperating Loving every moment that you walk by When the thing, when it bounces I tell you, you can get past my defenses And what do you see then? It's just somebody that you're hating Yeah, and that I'm telling you You were my safeness You were my greatness All of the dreams that we took back and see Now you can't tell me anything But just cooperate and see Or lies or nothing or above Now you don't even block me I'm just ignored And it was like heaven It was like so like fucking heaven That was so stupid Ah, I totally went on a different way than I was before Before it was like totally about the moment But then as so is congruent occupancy of most things in life You almost died but you were caught Did you see that? Did you see this? Oh no, I didn't pause, don't pause That's how cool I am You're gonna see back on that man, I caught you I caught you dog But what do you mean? What do you mean he's the one that caused the fail that I did? Because you didn't watch out for the cord See? That's what you get Unbiased opinion Singing a song about my past Um, destruction What? What? What? Anyways I don't even know if anybody can hear this So I'm gonna kick it back and like Call this one in Um, but I have to do more of these Um, I'm gonna have to look back at the quality of it Before I caught you, you know what I'm saying? And see what's up Anyways No one came There was one person that came And he was like Dave Beddington He was like, what's up dog? Dave Beddington Oh no, it's a dude Alright, later",

Is that what you adore? Or is it everybody's other view of you that you incorporate Into the thing that says that you can't relate With no gas here, no food, no higher power All we have is fear Standing on E Wasting ecstasy, the best of me And we're standing on E Siphoning the fuel in my life to give to you So you could succeed You got all this meal and all this amazement Why you gotta hate me? Cause I'm on E Emptying thoughts and stealing from my wife A thought that was mine that's gone and you don't see How much it hurts to be me I'm standing on fucking E I'm standing on fucking E I just want a little source of love Like I give everybody else It's too tough here all alone On my worst zone, your worst part Send me a sign to the room And I accept and accept and please Show you nothing but No dedication, laziness and hell I'm sorry I wanted to love you well too So now it seems as you call my friend There's more than that I see a light This ghost has all the ability to fight for me I don't wanna be on E anymore Come give me a source of healing Baby, a source of healing You were independent back when I came Something I can never understand Get up and make your plan go Just remember that Tethered to the love that's standing here behind you I'm the one that put you up there now Remember that when you go off Remember that when you think the world's too tough My hands right beside yours And your head's still hitting the pedal that makes you mine You're standing out here Baby Find some fuel in yourself too Make it brighter now",

Cause if you look down next to you You're gonna find me waiting on the things That you said you would be Waiting on the things that you swore were sweet Like the candy I know you are sweet Like the woman I know you came from, baby Can't you make her look that way when you look at me? Sweet Like a candy dot in the morning Do you have me in your love? Oh, then Tell Pummy how sweet frosting all over me, baby Treat you",

Jesus, he's been dead for a minute, right? 2021, we write the tales of tales. The people of God, they've frozen. Their lives are in hell. And their God is... so fucking dead. Hell is here. I'll see you there. But in the hell, I must fear. Holy, die for your sins too. Keep them inside and melt. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. I'll see you there.

Is there some place to make your mind right? Is this running to escape from the decisions that you won't face? Or place? Are you running to your own weight? Thinking all life was just mistakes And then you're gonna see it's gone like that And you didn't even give yourself a fucking break Yourself a fucking hit Yourself a fucking tell you that you're the fucking shit Cause you are, it's legit I'm telling you, you look in the mirror And it's the only one you ever know That you might as well be nice You might as well be cool Cause if you're not, you're just hurting yourself And everyone you come in contact with I'd like to give a shout out To the motherfucking fucking fathers That make their daughters love the way they do Because they never were taught love It's just a reciprocated package, a circle of flows And as I said before, then you should say that I know That I don't blame my parents' parents But I blame my parents' parents' parents For getting fooled by the regime By the money, by the banks For selling out our country like snakes The last mighty angel that fell before you May God wise in curves and tongues And tell you everything you dreamed of But in the end of that It'll be nothing but your own Sacrifice of the time That you could have made it on your own So don't let the serpent Sweep you away from your own Listen, it's here for you today I'm telling you one way or another This will be the end The thing that you used to either uplift or destroy Destroy, destroy So take a second and think what you're gonna do Take a second to think what you're not gonna do Just take one second before you spew All that hate, all that things Make you know you are right Before you spray that into our night Just know that we're listening All the way Not just a little bit, but all the way I'll be sorry The day that you leave before me I'll just shut it down Right now",

I miss when things were easier. I miss when things were all right. I miss when you used to hold me down, shit, tuck me in at night. I miss when I was a parental moment, wishing I could be all that and all the way, because I get lost in reality and I can't find a door in this maze. I just want to get lost in the feeling. I'm feeling, I'm feeling with you. Getting lost in the feeling. I'm feeling when I'm free with you. I get lost. I'm feeling that right in front of me. Feeling the world in front of me. Ooh, you know what I'm saying. Can you hear the music in your heart from the moment that you fear? Fear from the moment that you fear, from the moment that you fear, fear, it's all clear. This is the light right under your brain. Pass what they call insane, all here for us to name. Rearrange us to name. Brighter day. Feels when the world looks so fucking clear. It feels like you can't, can't ever care. Like the whole thing was worth it holding in your skin. Then I stopped. I missed the ways to look twins. The world was less like this and more, more like this. Yeah, talk to me, teach me something we should learn. Talk to me when you think this world isn't something we should learn. We should love our life forever. We won't try to fight us against each other. You know, we can find hope and peace where we grow. Just a level, come together. It's just a level of beauty in the world. It's trying to build it on our world. Trying to build it on our world. It's trying to build it on our world. Trying to build it on our world. When you feel alone, sit, talk to me. When you feel alone, I'm gonna be closer to you. I'll teach you to celebrate this moment to be alive. I'll teach you to celebrate this moment to be alive. Just a level, come together. You know, talk to me. Like lovers do. Talk to me.",
